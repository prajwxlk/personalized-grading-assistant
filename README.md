# Personalized Grading Assistant - Warpspeed 2023 GenAI Hackathon 

This is a hackathon build. It was made for the Warpspeed 2023 : GenAI Hackathon by Lightspeed. We built this tool in less than 36 hours for the same. I received a travel grant to attend this hackathon and I am really grateful for the same.

We worked on building a personalized grading assistant for students. Students would get tested on there course material and also get additional recommendation videos related to their topic to understand better.
